# Fall 2023 Semester Project

Reminder of Project Proposal Due Date:
10/16

Project Report Due Date:
12/06

----

1.  Identify a problem that is related to our class (data analysis, machine learning related)
2. Go ahead to collect data yourself, find data from Internet by crawling data, or identify
an existing dataset from some source.

If your project is purely theoretical and does not involve any data component, you do not need to
find data. However, we would encourage even simple example of your algorithm/theory applied
on real data to demonstrate that your algorithm/theory is working.

3. Analyze data and fit models using methods we did in class (or even outside of our class).

Careful design an evaluation method. Interpret your results, whether or not it makes sense or
are according to what you expect. Do you have a large enough sample size? Is your finding
statistically significant? Do you have a representative sample or its biased? How would you
improve your result? Can you use it for anything real?

4. Initial project proposal (minimum 2 pages, in font size 11, single spacing and single column,
using the template provided.

The final report should have minimum 4 pages, using the template
provided. (If you decided to use your own template, word or latex, please follow the same
format).

### Ideas
- Face detection on AI images. Classification/decomposition of image to find real faces vs. AI-generated faces
