## Data Science Sample Work

### Computer Vision Projects
[Face Detection on AI Generated Images](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/tree/main/Face_Detection_on_AI_Generated_Images)
* Face detection on AI images. Classification/decomposition of image to find real faces vs. AI-generated faces

[Yelp Resturaunt Reviews](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/tree/main/NLP_Sentiment_Analysis_Yelp)  

* Web Scraped unstructured text data from multiple sources (e.g. Amazon Reviews, Yelp Restaurant Reviews, Twitter hashtags, etc.)
* Cleaned, Transformed, and Formatted data to be reusable in modeling process
* Optimized different models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Unigrams to output the best results
* Business Decisions explored using model results

### Regression and Classification Model Projects:
[Predicting Bank Loan Approval](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/tree/263caf5c4e4587d46c72187b9081874bf19cf1c5/Bank_Loan_Prediction)  
[Predicting Diamond Prices](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/tree/263caf5c4e4587d46c72187b9081874bf19cf1c5/Diamond_Prices_Prediction)  
[Predicting Used Vehicle Prices](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/tree/263caf5c4e4587d46c72187b9081874bf19cf1c5/Used_Vehicles_Prediction)  
[Predicting Homes Prices](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/tree/263caf5c4e4587d46c72187b9081874bf19cf1c5/Real_Estate_Prices_Prediction)  

* Data engineered public data
* Optimized different models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Aritficial Nerual Networks to predict continuous target variable
* Used metrics from models to understand key insights and predict future outcomes

### Healthcare Prediction Project:
[Predicting Hypertension](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/tree/263caf5c4e4587d46c72187b9081874bf19cf1c5/Hypertension_Prediction)  

* Data engineered public health data
* Optimized different models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Aritficial Nerual Networks to predict target variable (blood pressure)
* Using metrics from output of model, insights gave information to predict Hypertension
* Further analysis not only shared prediction to Hypertension but features (symptoms) that strongly cause the disease.
