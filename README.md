Compilation of Sample Projects by Thomas Algenio

## Data Science Projects

### Computer Vision Projects
[Face Detection on AI Generated Images](https://github.com/ddaviddn/cda_fall2023_project)
* Face detection on AI images. Classification/decomposition of image to find real faces vs. AI-generated faces

### Healthcare Prediction Project:
[Predicting Hypertension](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/blob/main/Predicting%20Hypertension%20%26%20Symptoms.ipynb)  

* Data engineered public health data
* Optimized different models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Aritficial Nerual Networks to predict target variable (blood pressure)
* Using metrics from output of model, insights gave information to predict Hypertension
* Further analysis not only shared prediction to Hypertension but features (symptoms) that strongly cause the disease.

### NLP Sentiment Analysis Projects:
[Amazon Collagen Reviews](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/blob/main/NLP%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20Amazon%20Collagen.ipynb)  
[Amazon Preworkout Reviews](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/blob/main/NLP%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20Amazon%20Reviews%20-%20Preworkout%20products%20%26%20Health%20Risks.ipynb)  
[Twitter Gillette Unigram Model](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/blob/main/NLP%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20Gillette%20Unigram%20Model.ipynb)  
[Twitter #boycottgillette](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/blob/main/NLP%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20Twitter%20%23boycottgillettee%20Word%20Cloud.ipynb)  
[Twitter #gillettead](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/blob/main/NLP%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20Twitter%20%23gillettead%20Word%20Cloud.ipynb)

[Yelp Resturaunt Reviews](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/blob/main/NLP%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20Yelp%20Restaurant%20Reviews.ipynb)  

* Web Scraped unstructured text data from multiple sources (e.g. Amazon Reviews, Yelp Restaurant Reviews, Twitter hashtags, etc.)
* Cleaned, Transformed, and Formatted data to be reusable in modeling process
* Optimized different models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Unigrams to output the best results
* Business Decisions explored using model results

[Predicting Vehicle Prices](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/blob/main/Regression%20Model%20for%20Web%20Scraped%20Vehicle%20Data.ipynb)  
[Predicting Homes Prices](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/blob/main/Regression%20Predicting%20Price%20of%20Homes.ipynb)  

* Data engineered public data
* Optimized different models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Aritficial Nerual Networks to predict continuous target variable
* Used metrics from models to understand key insights and predict future outcomes
